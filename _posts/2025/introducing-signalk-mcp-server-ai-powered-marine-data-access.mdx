Imagine asking your boat "How are you doing today?" and receiving a comprehensive status report on batteries, solar charging, environmental conditions, and nearby vessels. Thanks to a new Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for SignalK, this conversational approach to boat monitoring is now a reality.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI assistants like Claude to securely connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a universal adapter that lets AI systems interact with your applications, databases, and services in a structured, secure way.

For SignalK users, this means your AI assistant can now:

- Query real-time vessel data
- Monitor AIS targets
- Check system alarms
- Analyze historical trends
- Discover available data paths

All through natural language conversations, without writing a single line of code.

## The SignalK MCP Server

The [signalk-mcp-server](https://github.com/tonybentley/signalk-mcp-server) is a new open-source project that bridges SignalK installations with MCP-compatible AI assistants. It provides read-only access to marine data systems, enabling AI-powered monitoring and analysis while maintaining security through its inability to control devices.

### Key Features

- **Real-time vessel data access** - Query navigation, electrical, environmental, and propulsion systems
- **AIS target monitoring** - Track nearby vessels with intelligent distance calculations
- **System notifications** - Monitor active alarms and warnings
- **Path discovery** - Automatically find available SignalK data streams
- **Automatic reconnection** - Maintains reliable connection to SignalK server
- **Zero device control** - Read-only operations ensure safety

### Installation

Getting started is simple. The server requires Node.js 18.0.0 or higher and access to a SignalK server (local or remote).

**Recommended: Using npx (no installation required)**

```bash
npx signalk-mcp-server
```

**Or install globally**

```bash
npm install -g signalk-mcp-server
```

The server can be configured using environment variables for SignalK host/port, authentication, and logging preferences.

## Real-World Usage: The Satori Project

To understand the transformative potential of this technology, let's look at a real deployment aboard _Satori_, a 1977 Westsail 32 cruising out of San Diego.

### From Dashboards to Conversations

_Satori's_ owner has integrated the SignalK MCP server with Claude Desktop, creating a system where the boat can be queried conversationally. Over a four-month period, this resulted in:

- **89 conversations** about boat status and systems
- **252 SignalK tool calls** for real-time data
- **192 InfluxDB queries** for historical analysis

But the numbers don't tell the full story. What matters is _how_ the interaction changed.

### Example: Morning Check-In

**User:** "how is satori doing today? batteries, and environment conditions?"

In a single query, the AI automatically:

1. Checked battery state of charge (100%), voltage (13.45V), and current draw (13.4A)
2. Calculated total solar production for the day (5.44 kWh from two controllers)
3. Read cabin environmental conditions (26.8°C, 42.3% humidity)
4. Verified bilge status (both forward and aft dry)

This replaced what would have been multiple dashboard checks, graph reviews, and manual calculations.

### Example: Historical Analysis

**User:** "how has the main battery doing. was it charged today?"

Rather than just answering "yes," the AI told a story:

> "The battery started at 99.8% at midnight, discharged to 96.9% by 2:30 AM, began charging at 3:00 AM, and reached 100% by 4:30 AM where it has stayed since. Currently receiving 13.2A charging current."

This narrative analysis of time-series data transforms raw numbers into actionable insights.

### Example: Situational Awareness

**User:** "what is the nearest vessel to satori right now"

The AI:

1. Queried AIS targets via SignalK
2. Retrieved _Satori's_ current position
3. Calculated distances using Haversine formula
4. Identified the nearest vessel: "MMSI 338311884, a 36-foot pleasure craft only 51 meters away, currently stationary"

Complex spatial calculations became as simple as asking a question.

## The "Satori Effect"

Something interesting emerged from these conversations: users stopped "checking systems" and started "asking how Satori is doing." This shift from technical monitoring to conversational relationship represents a fundamentally different interaction model.

Common query patterns that developed:

- **Morning check-ins**: "How is Satori?" - overnight charging, weather
- **Comparative analysis**: "Today vs yesterday" - solar production, power consumption
- **Troubleshooting**: Checking alarms, investigating anomalies
- **Environmental monitoring**: Temperature and humidity trends
- **Situational awareness**: Nearby vessels, position data

## Integration Architecture

_Satori_ demonstrates a sophisticated but accessible integration:

```
Boat Sensors → SignalK Server → MCP Server → Claude Desktop → User
                ↓
            InfluxDB (historical data)
```

The system combines:

- **SignalK** for real-time vessel data aggregation
- **InfluxDB** for time-series storage and historical analysis
- **MCP Server** to bridge AI access to both systems
- **Claude Desktop** as the conversational interface

This architecture enables seamless switching between real-time queries ("What's the battery voltage right now?") and historical analysis ("Show me the charging pattern over the last week").

## Available Tools

The SignalK MCP server exposes five core tools to AI assistants:

### `get_initial_context()`

Provides a comprehensive overview of the SignalK system, including server version, vessel information, and available data sources.

### `get_vessel_state()`

Retrieves current navigation data including position, course, speed, and heading.

### `get_ais_targets()`

Returns information about nearby vessels tracked via AIS, enabling situational awareness queries.

### `get_active_alarms()`

Monitors system notifications and warnings, helping identify issues that need attention.

### `list_available_paths()`

Discovers what data streams are available on your SignalK server, making it easy to explore new capabilities.

## Security Considerations

The SignalK MCP server is designed with safety in mind:

- **Read-only operations** - Cannot control devices or modify settings
- **No write access** - Eliminates risk of unintended system changes
- **Graceful error handling** - Fails safely if connections are lost
- **Connection validation** - Ensures proper authentication before data access

This makes it suitable for production use aboard vessels where system integrity is critical.

## Getting Started

Ready to add AI-powered monitoring to your SignalK installation? Here's how:

### 1. Install the MCP Server

```bash
npx signalk-mcp-server
```

### 2. Configure Connection

Set environment variables for your SignalK server:

```bash
SIGNALK_HOST=signalk.local
SIGNALK_PORT=3000
```

### 3. Connect Your AI Assistant

Add the MCP server to your Claude Desktop or Claude Code configuration. The server will automatically connect to SignalK and expose its tools to your AI assistant.

### 4. Start Asking Questions

Try queries like:

- "What's my current position?"
- "Show me battery voltage and state of charge"
- "What vessels are nearby?"
- "Are there any active alarms?"

The AI will automatically use the appropriate tools to answer your questions.

## What's Next?

The SignalK MCP server opens new possibilities for marine automation and monitoring:

- **Proactive alerts**: AI-driven anomaly detection across systems
- **Voyage planning**: Natural language query of route, weather, and vessel readiness
- **Maintenance tracking**: Conversational access to equipment hours and service schedules
- **Integration with other data sources**: Combining SignalK with weather APIs, marina databases, etc.
