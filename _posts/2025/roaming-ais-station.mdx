If you are in a well-populated area, you may notice that the position of your vessel on global tracking sites like MarineTraffic or VesselFinder is often updated in near-real-time. This is thanks to a network of AIS stations that relay the positions of vessels to these services. You can join this network by running a roaming AIS station on your boat, which will report your position and the positions of nearby vessels.

### Why Run a Roaming AIS Station?

- üìç **Track your own boat**: view your real-time position on marine traffic websites and share it with friends and family.
- üÜò **Improve safety at sea**: your roaming station may help relay the AIS position of vessels in distress in remote areas.
- üéÅ **Unlock perks**: services like [MarineTraffic offer premium benefits to AIS data partners](https://support.marinetraffic.com/en/articles/9552976-what-benefits-do-i-get-as-an-ais-partner).

### What You‚Äôll Need

To set up a roaming AIS station, you'll need to already have Signal K server running on your boat. Check out the [Getting Started with Signal K](https://demo.signalk.org/documentation/installation/) documentation and install it on your boat. You can run Signal K on a Raspberry Pi, a laptop, or any other computer that can connect to the internet and instruments on your boat.

To report the position of boats besides your own, you'll also need an AIS receiver and a connection to your Signal K server. If you do have AIS but it's not yet connected to Signal K, check out the [documentation on connecting Signal K to your NMEA network](https://demo.signalk.org/documentation/features/navdataserver/navdataserver.html). If you don't have AIS, there are some [low cost AIS receivers](https://shop.wegmatt.com/products/daisy-2-dual-channel-ais-receiver-with-nmea-0183?variant=7103563628580) that can simply be connected via USB to the computer running Signal K.

### Setting Up Your Roaming AIS Station

Once you have the prerequisites in place, setting up your roaming AIS station is shockingly simple (as with many things in Signal K).

1. Install one of the following plugins:
   1. _If you have an AIS onboard_, install the [ais-forwarder](https://github.com/hkapanen/ais-forwarder), which will forward your position and all AIS traffic.
   2. _If you don‚Äôt have an AIS onboard_, install the [aisreporter](https://github.com/SignalK/aisreporter) plugin, which will at least report your position.
2. Sign up for accounts with AIS reporting services:
   - [MarineTraffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/)
   - [VesselFinder](https://www.vesselfinder.com/)
   - [AISHub](https://www.aishub.net/)
3. Configure the plugin with the IP and ports provided by the AIS reporting services

That‚Äôs it‚Äîyour boat is now a roaming station that automatically reports AIS data, enhancing global coverage and making us all a little safer.
