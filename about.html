<h2>How it All Began</h2>

<p>
  Signal K began in a GitHub issue, as a solution for 5 developers to make their projects interoperable. Frustrated at
  the closed protocols, expensive hardware and internet “unfriendliness” of marine data, they decided to develop a new
  “Open Data Standard” that would compliment and expand the existing marine data protocols.
</p>
<p>
  By utilising modern web technologies and protocols, running on low cost but powerful hardware platforms and
  encouraging an open and collaborative community of developers all working to a common goal, they have managed to
  create a really powerful and expandable data format, that will change the marine electronics market forever.
</p>

<h2>Meet the Team</h2>

<p>
  Although the number of contributors and developers has significantly increased over the last few years, the core team
  of 5 developers and 1 installer/writer that made it all happen, are still actively involved and making sure their
  “baby” is growing as it should:

      I have been sailing for 15 years, always with my own embedded system on board, which has crossed the North Atlantic.
      First with a FoxBoard LX then an Arietta G25. In 2017, I discovered Signal K which already offered everything I needed.

  We are all sailors, and all geeks! We work as developers and specialists in a highly connected internet world, and we
  want to enjoy the benefits on our boats.
