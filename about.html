<h2>How it All Began</h2>

<p>
  Signal K began in <a href="https://github.com/tkurki/navgauge/issues/4">GitHub issue</a>, as a solution for 5 developers to make their projects interoperable. Frustrated at
  the closed protocols, expensive hardware and internet “unfriendliness” of marine data, they decided to develop a new
  “Open Data Standard” that would compliment and expand the existing marine data protocols.
</p>
<p>
  By utilising modern web technologies and protocols, running on low cost but powerful hardware platforms and
  encouraging an open and collaborative community of developers all working to a common goal, they have managed to
  create a really powerful and expandable data format, that keeps changing the marine electronics ecosystem in a more open direction.
