<h2>Signal K Demonstrator</h2>
<p>
  Currently most of the "cutting edge" development is being done on the Signal K Node-Server. Node is a popular development
  platform based on Google Chrome's JavaScript runtime environment and it can run on a lot of different hardware including
  x64, arm, arm64, ppc64le, power7, power8, and s390x.</p>
<p>
  One of the most popular hardware platforms for Signal K is the Raspberry Pi, which on a "Processing Power to Dollar" ratio,
  is pretty unbeatable and with so many people using it, getting help and support is much easier than for other platforms.</p>
<p>
  For those that prefer working in Java, there is also a Signal K Java-Server, but it is currently not fully up to date with the
  latest development work.</p>
<p>
  A fully working version of the latest Signal K Node-Server is currently running on the Signal K demo webserver and if you click
  on the link below it will open in a new tab. You will be taken to the Server's "Dashboard" where you can then click on the
  Webapps menu to see some typical Signal K Apps.</p>
<p>
  This is the same Node Server that you could be running on a Raspberry Pi on your boat and it would be your boat's real data
  being displayed in your web browser, rather than our demo data.</p>
