The Free and Open Source universal marine data exchange
----
SignalK is about publishing a common modern and open data format for marine use. A format for the modern boat,
compatible with NMEA, friendly to WiFi, cellphones, tablets, and the Internet. A format available to everyone, where
anyone can contribute.

Open Source
---
Yup. We intend to publish all source code under an Apache 2.0 license and everything else, like protocols and interface
descriptions, under a CC-BY-SA license.

That means that it is open source, but friendly to companies that want to use it in closed source applications or
hardware. As long as you contribute back we're happy.
